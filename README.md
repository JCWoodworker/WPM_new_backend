## Re-writing the entire server side code for the Woodworker's Project Management app.

### Currently building with (and learning) Nest JS:
  * Learned how to set up a Nest JS API
  * Learned how to handle different types of requests
  * Learned how to set up and interact with a PostgreSQL database.
  * Learned and implemented user authentication and encryption :-)

  * NEXT - deploying on Heroku
  
  * Getting closer every day to being able to implement the basic endpoints I'll need to re-create the original app!!
